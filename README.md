# E-commerce-Mobile-App

Objective: The project aims to create an e-commerce mobile app using React Native, which allows users to browse, search, and purchase products. The app will have user authentication, product listing, shopping cart, and payment integration. The backend will be built using ASP.NET, with PostgreSQL as the database and Docker for containerization. Azure DevOps will be used to manage the software development process, including CI/CD.

## Tasks:

* Set up the development environment and project structure using React Native, ASP.NET, and PostgreSQL.
* Design and implement the mobile app user interface, including screens for user registration/login, product listing, product detail, shopping cart, and checkout.
* Integrate the front end with the backend, including user authentication, product listing and search, shopping cart management, and payment processing.
* Configure Docker for containerization and set up Azure DevOps for project management, CI/CD, and deployment.
* Test the mobile app on different devices and platforms, and fix any issues that arise.
* Write documentation on the app's architecture, components, and usage.

## Expected Outcome:

Upon completing this project, the e-commerce mobile app should be fully functional, allowing users to browse, search, and purchase products from the platform. The app should have a responsive user interface and be compatible with various devices and platforms. The project should be well-documented.

## Deliverables:

* Source Code: The complete source code for the e-commerce mobile app, including both frontend (React Native) and backend (ASP.NET) components, as well as the database schema (PostgreSQL).
* Docker Configuration Files: Dockerfiles and other related configuration files for containerizing the app and its components, ensuring seamless deployment and easier management.
* Azure DevOps Configuration: Configured Azure DevOps pipeline for managing the software development process, including continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD).
* Test Cases and Results: A collection of test cases to verify the app's functionality on different devices and platforms, along with the corresponding results and any identified issues and their resolutions.
* User Documentation: A user guide detailing the app's features, usage, and any necessary setup
